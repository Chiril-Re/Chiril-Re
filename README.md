- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chiril-Re.
- I speak French, English, Russian. My Rouman is low level because I didn't used it for a long moment.
- I can understand Rouman, but speaking, reading and writing will be difficult. 
- I am now learning Japanese and Chinese.
- 👀 I’m interested in lites-novels, programming languages, parties and to meet new people.
- 🌱 I’m currently in my first session of my bachelor's degree in computer science in the Universiry of Montreal.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for this moment.
- 📫 You can reach me by using my email chiril.reabitchi@umontreal.ca
